Platform Shadow Usage Instructions:

1) Drag the "Platform Shadow" prefab object into your scene / character prefab so that the character is its parent.
2) Adjust the position of the Platform Shadow to be centred just beneath your character's feet.
3) Adjust the import settings of the "Pixel.png" sprite so that the Pixels Per Unit setting is the same as your character's.
	- Ideally, this is the same across your entire project, best set to 100.
4) Set the inspector variables in the PlatformShadow component to your preference.
5) Enjoy!
